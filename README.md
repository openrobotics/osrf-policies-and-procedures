# Open Source Robotics Foundation - Policies and Procedures

This repository contains official Policies and Procedures (P&P) of the Open Source Robotics Foundation, Inc. (OSRF).
Each Markdown document is one P&P document, with a specific scope.

The versions of the P&P documents in the `main` branch are the most-recently-ratified versions.
Proposed revisions are kept in branches of this repository (or forks, if being proposed by people outside the OSRF).
These branches must go through a pull request to be merged into `main`; merges are overseen by OSRF management.
To propose changes to one of the P&P documents, fork this repository, make your proposed changes, open a pull request, and then contact the OSRF management at info@openrobotics.org.

OSRF management may alter these P&P documents at any time and for any reason in keeping with the Charter of the OSRF.
Not all official policies of the OSRF are stored in this repository, but we are doing our best to do so.
