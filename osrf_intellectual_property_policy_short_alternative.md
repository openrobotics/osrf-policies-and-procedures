II. Overview

The purpose of the Open Source Robotics Foundation Intellectual Property Policy ("IP Policy") is to set forth the general principles under which the OSRF shall:

a)  accept Content,

b)  distribut Content,

c)  host Content, and

d)  manage other intellectual property matters.

This IP Policy is intended to address intellectual property issues associated with Content. Other intellectual property issues, including patents, may be addressed in other policies of the OSRF or in licenses used by the OSRF.

This IP Policy applies only to Content Submitted to the OSRF on or after the effective date of this version of the IP Policy, provided however, that to the extent Content is Submitted which includes elements which were Submitted before the effective date, this Policy only applies to the elements of that Content Submitted for the first time after the effective date. Any Content Submitted prior to the effective date of this version of the IP Policy will be governed by the version of the IP Policy in effect at the time of Submission.

This IP Policy should at all times be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the Purposes of the OSRF as set forth in the Bylaws.

The OSRF shall be responsible for implementing this IP Policy with respect to all Content, through such structures and committees as adopted by the Board for, but not exclusively for, this purpose.

In the event of a dispute between the OSRF and the TGC or a PMC, Project Leader, or a Committer, the TGC or the responsible PMC shall have the right to appeal to the Board for resolution of such dispute.

III. Inbound Contributions

All Submissions of Project Content to the OSRF will be accompanied by a Developers Certificate of Origin (DCO) statement. This statement shall be submitted through an OSRF-approved Submission process. All Submissions shall be made in accordance with one of the following methods of providing distribution and usage rights to the OSRF.

a)  Pursuant to the Apache License, Version 2.0.

b)  Pursuant to another Open Source Initiative-approved license compatible with the existing Project Content of the same Project at the time of Submission, and approved for use by the OSRF.

c)  At the election of the Contributor, a Board-approved Contribution Agreement.

For clarity, the OSRF shall make the final determination on all such licensing matters, subject to the right of Board appeal by the PMC.

The OSRF shall maintain a list of permitted Project Licenses, such list to be subject to approval by the Board or appropriate committees of the OSRF as delegated by the Board.

IV. Outbound Distributions

The OSRF will release Project Content under the license(s) under which that Project Content was developed. For Project Content provided to the OSRF without a specified license but via some other mechanism for assigning copyright to the OSRF, the OSRF will release that Project Content under the Apache License, Version 2.0, or the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International ("CC BY-NC 4.0") license, or a more recent version of that license if available and at the sole discretion of the OSRF.

V.  Due Diligence and Record Keeping

The OSRF, working in conjunction with the TGC, the PMCs and Committers, is responsible for ensuring that each Project produces sufficient documentation such that downstream users and adopters are made aware of each instance of Third Party Content and all applicable licenses. For clarity, the OSRF shall make the final determination on all project license documentation matters, subject to the right of Board appeal by the TGC or the applicable PMC(s).

Except as otherwise described below, the OSRF, working with the TGC and the applicable PMC(s) and Committer(s), shall ensure compliance with this IP Policy by conducting the following activities prior to placing any Submissions into the Repository and/or otherwise making such Content available as Distributed Content.

If there are any doubts about the ability to Distribute the Content as described in Section IV of this IP Policy, the Committer may not place the Content in the Repository or otherwise Distribute the Content and should contact the PMC, the TGC and the OSRF for assistance.

All necessary license obligations must be fulfilled for any Content to be made available as Distributed Content for which Required Due Diligence has not been completed. Such license obligations may include, but are not limited to, terms and conditions that must appear in notices and agreements governing the use of such Content when it is made available as Distributed Content.

VI. Confidential Information

The OSRF, Member(s), Committer(s) and other parties may exchange information as a result of their participation in Projects and/or generally in the furtherance of the Purposes of the OSRF. All such information shall be considered non-confidential and provided under terms consistent with this IP Policy. In the event confidential information needs to be shared, such confidential information shall be disclosed pursuant to a confidentiality agreement entered into by the participants in such disclosure.

VII. Legal Review

The OSRF's policy is to discuss thoroughly with legal counsel any proposed programs or policy decisions before they are implemented. If any member or participant has any question as to the legality of a proposed course of action, the matter should be immediately referred to the General Counsel of the OSRF. In this manner, the OSRF can ensure continued pursuit of its legitimate objectives with maximum protection for members and participants.

VIII. Changes to IP Policy

The Board is empowered to approve changes to this IP Policy. After any such Board approval, a minimum of thirty (30) days' notice shall be provided to all Committers of the new version of this IP Policy before it becomes effective.

IX. Disclaimers

Under no circumstances should this IP Policy be interpreted to be a representation, warranty, condition, or other form of guarantee that the intellectual property rights of a Member, Committer, Submitter, or any other party, will not be infringed if this IP Policy is complied with. In addition, the OSRF, Members, Committers, and their respective employees and agents shall have no liability of any kind (including, but not limited to, direct, indirect, incidental, punitive, special, and consequential damages) to each other or to any other party with respect to this IP Policy including, but not limited to, failure to comply with this IP Policy to the extent permitted under applicable law.

The OSRF, Members, Committers, and their respective employees and agents hereby disclaim all representations, warranties, and conditions, express, implied and statutory including, but not limited to, any representation or warranty of non-infringement relating to any software or product made available through the OSRF.
