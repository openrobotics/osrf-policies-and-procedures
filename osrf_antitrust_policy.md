I.  Introduction

The mission of the Open Source Robotics Foundation ("OSRF") is to support, promote, protect, and standardize open-source software for robotic systems. As part of that, the OSRF supports the creation of a technical and business environment for its open source projects. The purpose of this Antitrust Policy (the "Policy") is to avoid antitrust risks in carrying out this mission.

It is the OSRF's policy to comply with all applicable state and federal antitrust and trade regulation laws, and applicable antitrust/competition laws of other countries (collectively, the "Antitrust Laws"). The penalties for violating the Antitrust Laws can be severe, including treble damages in the United States of America, and large fines and imprisonment of individuals found guilty of illegal conduct. The Supreme Court of the United States of America has ruled that a trade association may be held legally responsible for the unauthorized, as well as authorized, acts of its members.

The OSRF will use its best reasonable efforts to comply in all respects with the Antitrust Laws. In addition, all members of the OSRF's Open Source Robotics Alliance Initiative (the "OSRA") (collectively, "members") must likewise use their best reasonable efforts to comply in all respects with the Antitrust Laws and this Policy in carrying out OSRF- and OSRA-related activities, as must all non-members who participate in such activities, whether directly or indirectly, including without limitation, participants in the OSRA's committees, special interest groups, and working groups, and the OSRF's employees, consultants, directors and officers (all such non-member participants, "participants").

Each Member acknowledges that the Members are committed to fostering competition in the development of new products and services and that the OSRF's activities are intended to promote and support such competition. The Members further acknowledge that some of them may compete with one another in various lines of business and that it is therefore imperative that they and their representatives act in a manner that does not violate any applicable antitrust laws and regulations.

The goal of Antitrust Laws is to encourage vigorous and fair competition. Nothing in this Policy, or in any document or policy of the OSRF, prohibits or limits the ability of members or participants to make, sell, or use any product, or otherwise to compete in the marketplace. This Policy provides general guidance on compliance with Antitrust Law. Members and participants should contact their respective legal counsel to address specific questions.

This Policy is conservative and intended to promote compliance with the Antitrust Laws, not to create duties or obligations beyond what the Antitrust Laws actually require. In the event of any inconsistency between this Policy and the Antitrust Laws, the Antitrust Laws preempt and control.

This Policy shall be promulgated to all members and participants.

The following policies address three areas in which the Antitrust Laws are particularly concerned: Membership; Conduct of Meetings; and Requirements/Standard Setting.

II. Membership

Membership in the OSRA shall be made available on reasonable terms to all individuals and entities meeting the qualifications established by the OSRF for membership, as set forth in the Charter of the OSRA. No applicant for membership who meets the membership criteria should be rejected for any anti-competitive purpose or solely for the purpose of denying the applicant the benefits of membership.

Any OSRA information, materials, or reports available to members shall be made available to non-members on reasonable terms, when failure to make them available will impose a significant economic or competitive disadvantage or cost to non-members.

III. Conduct of Meetings

At meetings among actual or potential competitors, there is a risk that participants in those meetings may improperly disclose or discuss information in violation of the Antitrust Laws, or otherwise act in an anti-competitive manner. To avoid this risk, members and participants must adhere to the following policies when participating in OSRF- and OSRA-related or sponsored meetings, conference calls, or other forums.

Members and participants **must not**, in fact or appearance, discuss or exchange information regarding any of the following.

1.  An individual company's current or projected prices, price changes, price differentials, markups, discounts, allowances, terms and conditions of sale, including credit terms, etc., or data that bear on prices, including profits, margins, or cost.

2.  Industry-wide pricing policies, price levels, price changes, differentials, or the like.

3.  Actual or projected changes in industry production, capacity, or inventories.

4.  Matters relating to bids or intentions to bid for particular products, procedures for responding to bid invitations, or specific contractual arrangements.

5.  Plans of individual companies concerning the design, characteristics, production, distribution, marketing, or introduction dates of particular products, including proposed territories or customers.

6.  Matters relating to actual or potential individual suppliers that might have the effect of excluding them from any market or of influencing the business conduct of firms toward such suppliers.

7.  Matters relating to actual or potential customers that might have the effect of influencing the business conduct of firms toward such customers.

8.  Individual company current or projected cost of procurement, development, or manufacture of any product.

9.  Individual company market shares for any product or for all products.

10. Confidential or otherwise sensitive business plans or strategy.

In connection with all OSRF- or OSRA-related meetings, conference calls, or other forums for exchange of information, members and participants **must do** the following.

1.  Adhere to prepared agendas.

2.  Insist that the meeting minutes be prepared and distributed to all participants, and that meeting minutes accurately reflect the matters that transpired.

3.  Understand the purposes and authority of each OSRA committee, special interest group, working group, or other group in which they participate.

4.  Consult with their respective counsel on all antitrust questions related to OSRF or OSRA meetings.

5.  Protest against any discussions that appear to violate these policies or the Antitrust Laws, leave any meeting in which such discussions continue, and either insist that such protest be noted in the minutes, of occurring during a meeting, or make such protest known to the Legal Counsel of the OSRF (see Contact Information, below).

IV. Requirements/Standard Setting

The OSRF and its committees, special interest groups, and working groups may establish standards, technical requirements and/or specifications for products based on or utilizing open source projects of the OSRF (collectively, "requirements"). All such requirements shall be voluntary. Members and participants shall not enter into agreements that prohibit or restrict any member or non-member from establishing or adopting any other requirements. Members and participants shall not undertake any efforts, directly or indirectly, to prevent any individual or company from manufacturing, selling, or supplying any product not conforming to a requirement.

Neither participation in activities of the OSRF nor the OSRF's approval or release of a specification or software program shall require any member to use or implement the specification or software program, to preclude any member from developing or employing additional, competing, or alternative products or specifications or software programs, or to foreclose taking a different course of action should any member so desire.

Parties who may be affected by a requirement adopted by a committee, special interest group or working group shall be given the opportunity to comment on the development of any such requirement, regardless of whether they are members of the OSRA. The OSRF, OSRA and its committees, special interest groups, and working groups will publish all proposed requirements on the OSRF and/or OSRA website for a reasonable period of time prior to formal adoption and shall consider comments to those proposed requirements prior to adopting a final requirement.

OSRA committees, special interest groups, and working groups shall develop and select requirements based on their quality, technological attributes, and ability to address the needs of users of OSRF open source software. OSRA committees, special interest groups, and working groups shall not promote standardization of commercial terms, such as terms for license and sale.

All members and participants shall execute and abide by all applicable rules, policies, and procedures adopted by the OSRF, the OSRA, or the applicable committee, special interest group or working group, as updated from time to time (collectively "OSRF Policies"). Requirements developed by committees, special interest groups, and working groups shall not incorporate any information that is proprietary, confidential, or otherwise would require a manufacturer, developer, or end user of a product conforming to the requirements to obtain a license or permission from any third party to use the requirements. When participating in the development of requirements, members and participants in the process shall not contribute information that is proprietary, confidential, or otherwise protected by rights belonging to that member, participant, or any third party except as may be permitted in accordance with OSRF Policies.

V.  Legal Review

The OSRF's policy is to discuss thoroughly with legal counsel any proposed programs or policy decisions before they are implemented. If any member or participant has any question as to the legality of a proposed course of action, the matter should be immediately referred to the General Counsel of the OSRF. In this manner, the OSRF can ensure continued pursuit of its legitimate objectives with maximum protection for members and participants.
