II. Overview

The purpose of the Open Source Robotics Foundation Intellectual Property Policy ("IP Policy") is to set forth the general principles under which the OSRF shall:

a)  accept Content,

b)  distribut Content,

c)  host Content, and

d)  manage other intellectual property matters.

This IP Policy is intended to address intellectual property issues associated with Content. Other intellectual property issues, including patents, may be addressed in other policies of the OSRF or in licenses used by the OSRF.

This IP Policy applies only to Content contributed to the OSRF on or after the Effective Date of this version of the IP Policy, provided however, that to the extent Content is contributed which includes elements which were contributed before the Effective Date, this Policy only applies to the elements of that Content contributed for the first time after the Effective Date. Any Content contributed prior to the Effective Date of this version of the IP Policy will be governed by the version of the IP Policy in effect at the time of contribution.

This IP Policy should at all times be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the Purposes of the OSRF as set forth in the Bylaws.

The OSRF shall be responsible for implementing this IP Policy with respect to all Content, through such structures and committees as adopted by the Board for, but not exclusively for, this purpose.

In the event of a dispute between the OSRF and the TGC or a PMC, Project Leader, or a Committer, the TGC or the responsible PMC shall have the right to appeal to the Board for resolution of such dispute.

III. Inbound Contributions

The OSRF, working in conjunction with the TGC, PMCs and Committers, is responsible for ensuring that the Project Licenses and Third Party Licenses used by each Project are not inconsistent or in conflict with one another. For clarity, the OSRF shall make the final determination on all such licensing matters, subject to the right of Board appeal by the PMC. The OSRF shall maintain a list of permitted Project Licenses, such list to be subject to approval by the Board or appropriate committees of the OSRF as delegated by the Board.

Each Project shall specify one or more of the permitted Project Licenses during its chartering by the OSRF under a project chartering process approved by the Board. For each Project the specified Project Licenses shall serve as the primary licenses under which the OSRF shall accept Project Content.

The OSRF will only Distribute Distributed Content as described in Section IV below under the terms and conditions other than the Project License(s) when: (a) a Committer has determined that Third Party Content is important to achieving the goals of the Project and (b) the OSRF has determined that the license of the Third Party Content is not inconsistent or in conflict with the Project License(s).

The mechanisms by which the OSRF obtains rights to Submissions sufficient to distribute them as Distributed Content are:

a)  a Committer Agreement;

b)  a Contribution Agreement;

c)  explicit license grants as stipulated by Submitters with respect to each Submission; or

d)  as otherwise mutually agreed upon by the Submitter and the OSRF.

It is the responsibility of the OSRF to ensure that for each Submission which is accepted for redistribution as Distributed Content:

a)  sufficient controls are in place to ensure that for each such Submission the Content is placed in the Repository by a Committer;

b)  sufficient license grants under the Project Licenses and/or Third Party Licenses are obtained as to allow the redistribution of such Content as described below in Section IV; and

c)  the due diligence and record keeping described in Section V be performed.

It is the responsibility of the OSRF to ensure that for each Submission which is to be made available as Hosted Content:

a)  sufficient controls are in place to ensure that for each such Submission which is Code Content that such Code Content is placed in the Hosted Repository by a Committer;

b)  sufficient license grants are obtained as to allow the hosting of such Content as described below in Section IV;

c)  the due diligence and record keeping described in Section V for Hosted Content be performed; and

d)  such Hosted Content will only be made available through a Hosted Repository.

IV. Outbound Distributions

Except as set forth below, to the extent Content is accepted under a license other than the Project License(s) specified for the Project under Section III of this IP Policy, the Project License(s) for a Project developed from such Project Content shall be the license(s) under which such Project Content was accepted.

Third Party Content shall be Distributed under the terms and conditions under which it was obtained. As an exception to the foregoing sentence, if requested by the TGC or responsible PMC and agreed to by the OSRF, Third Party Content may instead be Distributed under the terms and conditions of the Project License.

In limited circumstances, there may be instances where Project Content based on Third Party Content may be approved for Distribution by the OSRF under terms and conditions other than the Project License(s). In these instances, the OSRF may decide that the terms and conditions of the license governing the Third Party Content will apply to such Project Content. Examples include but are not limited to:

a)  bug fixes of Third Party Content to be maintained as Project Content where the developer(s) of the Third Party Content is unable or unwilling to provide such bug fix; and

b)  derivative works of Third Party Content to be maintained as Project Content where the developer(s) of the Third Party Content is unable or unwilling to maintain the derivative work.

Third Party Content shall only be Distributed when it has been approved by the OSRF after its completion of the due diligence and record keeping requirements set forth in Section V and the OSRF has approved the terms and conditions of the license for such Third Party Content.

Before any Content is place in the Repository or made available for download or other method of distribution, the applicable Committer(s) must ensure that the terms and conditions governing the subsequent use of the Content are clearly communicated to potential recipients or users of the Content.

V.  Due Diligence and Record Keeping

The OSRF, working in conjunction with the TGC, the PMCs and Committers, is responsible for ensuring that each Project produces sufficient documentation such that downstream users and adopters are made aware of each instance of Third Party Content and all applicable Project Licenses and Third Party Licenses. For clarity, the OSRF shall make the final determination on all project license documentation matters, subject to the right of Board appeal by the TGC or the applicable PMC(s). The OSRF will provide tools and processes to assist in the creation of such documentation by each Project.

Except as otherwise described below, the OSRF, working with the TGC and the applicable PMC(s) and Committer(s), shall ensure compliance with this IP Policy by conducting the following activities prior to placing any Submissions into the Repository and/or otherwise making such Content available as Distributed Content.

If there are any doubts about the ability to Distribute the Content as described in Section IV of this IP Policy, the Committer may not place the Content in the Repository or otherwise Distribute the Content and should contact the PMC, the TGC and the OSRF for assistance.

Each PMC or the OSRF shall be responsible for filing/maintaining the information collected by its Committer(s) for future reference as needed.

All necessary license obligations must be fulfilled for any Content to be made available as Distributed Content for which Required Due Diligence has not been completed. Such license obligations may include, but are not limited to, terms and conditions that must appear in notices and agreements governing the use of such Content when it is made available as Distributed Content.

The due diligence and record keeping requirements described below in this section shall not apply to:

a)  content which is not Distributed Content, except as specified below in Section for Hosted Content; and

b)  minor (as determined by the OSRF) modifications to Distributed Content.

While the record keeping requirements do not apply to those items listed above, Committers must conduct reasonable due diligence to satisfy themselves that proposed Submissions can be Distributed as described in Section IV.

A.  In the Case of Project Content

For Submissions of Content which are the original work of a Committer or Committer's employer, that Submission shall be made under the same terms as any other Submitter.

For any other Submissions of Content by a Submitter, the OSRF, working with the TGC, the applicable PMC(s) and Committer(s), shall approve the use of such Content as Project Content by ensuring that:

a)  the Submitter has a valid and current Contribution Agreement; and

b)  reasonable judgement shall be used to determine if the Content can be Distributed as described in Section IV of this IP Policy.

```
B.  In the case of Third Party Content

Projects must verify that all Third Party Licenses conform to the then-current licensing guidelines as provided by the OSRF. To do so, Projects must follow a process provided by the OSRF, using parameters provided by the OSRF, to: (a) obtain the terms and conditions under which such Content would be distributed by the OSRF, and (b) ensure that such terms are not inconsistent or in conflict with the Project Licenses. Should the outputs provided by the process indicate any issue or ambiguity with respect to the terms or Compatible licenses (an "IP Concern"), the Project Leader must ensure that the Project reports the IP Concern to the OSRF, using the contact information provided in Section VII. No further approvals will be required from the OSRF prior to Projects placing the Third Party Content into the Repository. Reasonable judgement shall be used to determine if the Content can be Distributed as Third Party Content as described in Section IV of this IP Policy.

C.  In the Case of Hosted Content

For each Submission of Hosted Content by a Submitter it will be the responsibility of the OSRF to ensure that automated systems are in place to ensure that the following information is recorded:

a)  the name (including, as applicable, the namespace) of the Code Content,

b)  the name and website URL of the organization from which the Code Content originates,

c)  the version number (as applicable) of the Code Content, and

d)  the license(s) and version (as applicable) under which the Code Content is made available, including a complete copy of the same.

It will be the responsibility of the OSRF to ensure that the license(s) under which Submissions of Code Content are made available as Hosted Content have been reviewed and approved by the OSRF for use by Code Content in a Hosted Repository.

For Submissions of Non-Code Content as Hosted Content, there shall be no data collection or due diligence requirements, except that it will be the responsibility of the OSRF to ensure that the terms and conditions which govern the use of Non-Code Content made available in a Hosted Repository are a license approved by the OSRF for Non-Code Content.

VI. Confidential Information

The OSRF, Member(s), Committer(s) and other parties may exchange information as a result of their participation in Projects and/or generally in the furtherance of the Purposes of the OSRF. All such information shall be considered non-confidential and provided under terms consistent with this IP Policy. In the event confidential information needs to be shared, such confidential information shall be disclosed pursuant to a confidentiality agreement entered into by the participants in such disclosure.

VII. Legal Review

The OSRF's policy is to discuss thoroughly with legal counsel any proposed programs or policy decisions before they are implemented. If any member or participant has any question as to the legality of a proposed course of action, the matter should be immediately referred to the General Counsel of the OSRF. In this manner, the OSRF can ensure continued pursuit of its legitimate objectives with maximum protection for members and participants.

VIII. Changes to IP Policy

The Board is empowered to approve changes to this IP Policy. After any such Board approval, a minimum of thirty (30) days' notice shall be provided to all Committers of the new version of this IP Policy before it becomes effective.

IX. Disclaimers

Under no circumstances should this IP Policy be interpreted to be a representation, warranty, condition, or other form of guarantee that the intellectual property rights of a Member, Committer, Submitter, or any other party, will not be infringed if this IP Policy is complied with. In addition, the OSRF, Members, Committers, and their respective employees and agents shall have no liability of any kind (including, but not limited to, direct, indirect, incidental, punitive, special, and consequential damages) to each other or to any other party with respect to this IP Policy including, but not limited to, failure to comply with this IP Policy to the extent permitted under applicable law.

The OSRF, Members, Committers, and their respective employees and agents hereby disclaim all representations, warranties, and conditions, express, implied and statutory including, but not limited to, any representation or warranty of non-infringement relating to any software or product made available through the OSRF.
